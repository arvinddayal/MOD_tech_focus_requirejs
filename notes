-dont need ".js", Require assumes everything is a JS file

-require is for immediately running a function
-define is for defining modules
-As of jQuery 1.7, it comes with support for AMD as it implements the AMD spec, so we can use it. You can see this right at the bottom of the un-minified source:

cons
-multiple HTTP requests for each file.  Unminified/uglified (optimizer)
-have to scripts with require/define statements
-have to wrap all code in anonymous functions, on all files/modules
-learning curve for developers and maintenance

pros
-modular approach to app development/script management, smaller chunks of code to manage and debug
-can see exact dependencies at top of app/module
-performance, only load what's needed
-ability to load nested dependencies
-solid community and support
