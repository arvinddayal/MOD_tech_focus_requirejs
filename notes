-RequireJS uses Asynchronous Module Loading (AMD) for loading files.  requirejs.config function allows to create dependency and load order

-RequireJS is a well known JavaScript module and file loader which is supported in the latest versions of popular browsers. 
	-IE 6+
	-Firefox 2+
	-Safari 3.2+
	-Chrome 3+
	-Opera 10+

-dont need ".js", Require assumes everything is a JS file

-require is for immediately running a function
-define is for defining modules
-As of jQuery 1.7, it comes with support for AMD as it implements the AMD spec, so we can use it. You can see this right at the bottom of the un-minified source:

cons
-have to rewrite scripts with require/define statements

pros
-solid community and support
-RequireJS waits until all the dependent modules are loaded before executing the functionality. If any modules are missing, it doesnâ€™t execute any code.
